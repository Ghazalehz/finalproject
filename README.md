# Final Project

Everything for the final project for the Ubiqum bootcamp will go here.

In this project I'll do sentiment analyses of a number of classic books (currently Crime & Punishment, Charlie and Chocolate Factory, 1984 & Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) and will also do a visualisation using Tableau and / or Shiny.

You'll find the full project on http://www.databarcelona.com/sentiments.html.

Here's a preview:
